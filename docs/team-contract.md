## Meetings

- All members will attend these meetings or notify the team in advance of anticipated absences. We all agree that absences should be rare.
- All group members will come to the meetings prepared by:
  - reading the assigned material (as much as possible), and
  - coming with ideas pertaining to the tasks and decisions to be made.
- Members will not work on other assignments during meetings and will be engaged.
- Decisions can be made during meetings even some members are absent.
- Each member will take turns listening as well as talking, and active listening will be a strategy for all group discussions.

- Alena will take notes during all meetings.
